# Recall proposal

## Intro

There are two main types of memory that learners use: recall, and recognition.

Recognition requires that the learner be familiar with information that is being presented to you. When learners take multiple choice exams, for instance, they are using recognition memory.

Recall requires you to go a step further and retrieve information from memory. In this way, [recall requires more work than recognition][1]. When you take short answer, or fill-in-the-blank exams, you are utilizing this form of memory. (We all dreaded those exams, didn't we?)

## Problem

Scientific research shows that both recognition and recall are both important, but recall shows you _really know_ what you are talking about.  Unfortunately, learners usually give up after the recognition phase, and cease to reap the long-term retention benefits of recall.

## Solution

Studying should be designed so that the learner can focus on recall of key terms and facts. This is why I propose an application designed to help learners do just this. **Recall** is designed to remove keywords from a sentence and present it back to the user, expecting the learner to be able to fill in the blanks. For example, the sentence "The cell is the basic unit of life," could become "The ---- is the basic ---- of life."
